# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!
Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Roman Dykyi, an aspiring web developer with a keen interest in building web applications using ASP.NET and the .NET ecosystem. While my journey began with game development in Unity, it sparked a deep curiosity about programming and system design. I've since focused on developing projects with ASP.NET, honing skills in C#, web APIs, and database integration, and I am eager to contribute to creating efficient and scalable web solutions.
